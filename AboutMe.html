		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello World! I am Kyjah Clarke, a Navy Firefighter, stationed in Norfolk, Virginia at firefighting schoolhouse as an instructor. I teach the fleet various firefighting techniques and add to their level of knowledge. I am passionate in what I do and enjoy having the ability to teach something that I love. From a young age, firefighter was always a career choice as well as being in the military and with that, I am happy I get to do both. 
This website, I hope to continue to share my passion with firefighting and provide my prototype application to resolve the issue of the lack of communication or delayed communication being passed during a casualty through various channels and fire stations.
